# Neuronal Analysis: Artificial Neuron Modelling and Data Exploration

## Overview

This repository contains analysis and modelling work on artificial neurons based on experimental datasets. The project focuses on two datasets, **YEB** and **OCA**, containing recordings of neurons (1 to 6) from mice. It includes a Jupyter Notebook for detailed exploration, ground truth data, trial numbers, and a written paper summarizing the findings and methodologies.

## Files
